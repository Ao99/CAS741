This document describes procedures concerning the unit testing for \progname{}
for compliance with the requirements.

Some general information such as introduction to the software and testing
scopes are included in Section \ref{sec_geinfo}. Verification plans and
test tools are in Section \ref{sec_plan}.

\section{General Information}
\label{sec_geinfo}

\subsection{Purpose}

The software going through the test is Medical Imaging Segmentation
(\progname{}).

Segmentation, separation of structures of interest from the background and from
each other~\cite{Bankman2000}. Image segmentation is the process of
partitioning an image into different meaningful segments. In medical imaging,
these segments
often correspond to different tissue classes, organs, pathologies, or other
biologically relevant structures~\cite{Forouzanfar2010}.

\progname{} uses one of many segmentation algorithms - the Intensity Threshold
method. It also uses Otsu's Method to find the optimal threshold value(s).
After receiving input medical image from the users, \progname{} calculates the
optimal threshold value(s), and output the processed segmentation image.

\subsection{Scope}

The Input Module relies on a library developed by others, so it will not be
tested within the scope of this document.

The modules that are going to be tested are Image Data Structure, Optimal
Thresholds Calculation, Output Module and Image Verification.

dependencies between the test cases and the requirements.
